To Do:

o avoid colliding with non-active waypoints
o have a player robot, player controls the robot
  Basically create a robot with AISTYLE = "human"
  And if human, it checks user events to control thrust (accel)
o add fuel -- using thrust expends your limmited fuel supply1

o AI2 (3rd one); look ahead of target, aim for where it will be in N seconds.
o AI3 (4th one); better than ai2 for stationary waypoints but not for moving waypoints 
o AI4 (5th one) by Sam
